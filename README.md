### :muscle: Project

<b>DevNet</b> is a project from [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/) that aims to connect Developers through a platform where they can publish, like, and comment on each other's posts, show off their GitHub projects, and build a network of developers. Access it through: https://arcane-dawn-30816.herokuapp.com/

### üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Author's considerations

This fullstack project is filled with the most current webdesign technologies, the challenge went over concepts of backend and frontend integration, REST api, Database connection, and Redux setup and maintenance among others that had to be introduced. Thankfully the classes [COMP 2912 - Node.js](https://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/comp2912) and [COMP 1630 - Database Design](https://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/comp1630) were permeated with knowledge and useful thoughts from experienced professionals.

React library was vastly used in this project, the choice was due it's demand nowadays, and the amount of tools that can be used with it.
After finishing [COMP 2913 - React and Modern JavaScript](https://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/comp2913) at BCIT I was convinced that the foreseeable future of frontend was in react, thanks to the use that can be given it and the ease of use, but at the same time, it felt a lot like an introduction and awakened a stronger hunger to keep learning and developing other projects.

It was great to use some useful tools like <b>Redux</b>, that offers global state management, <b>MongoDB</b>, and its amazing and intuitive tools, and <b>Postman</b>, a needful technology for any API building.

The project was packed of small details and use of APIs like [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) and [Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/), and lots of hands on with Redux and MongoDB. The chosen stack is very powerful and quite enjoyable to work with. And I could call it a milestone in my journey.
